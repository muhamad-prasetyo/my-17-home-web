# Filament Production Setup

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to make Filament work properly in production environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model Updates
The `User` model has been updated to implement the `FilamentUser` contract required for production environments:

- Added `FilamentUser` contract implementation
- Added `canAccessPanel()` method with multiple authentication options
- Added all missing model imports

### 2. Configuration Updates
- Added `APP_COMPANY_DOMAIN` environment variable
- Updated `config/app.php` with company domain configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with the new environment variable

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add this to your `.env` file:
```
APP_COMPANY_DOMAIN=your-company.com
```

### User Access Control
The `canAccessPanel()` method provides three ways to control access:

1. **Role-based access**: Users with roles `super_admin`, `admin`, or `panel_user`
2. **Email domain-based access**: Users with email addresses from your company domain
3. **Approval-based access**: Users with `is_approved` field set to true

### Setting Up Access

#### Option 1: Using Roles (Recommended)
```php
// Assign admin role to a user
$user = User::find(1);
$user->assignRole('admin');
```

#### Option 2: Using Company Domain
Set your company domain in `.env`:
```
APP_COMPANY_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```
Users with emails like `admin@yourdomain.com` will have access.

#### Option 3: Using Approval Field
```php
// Approve a user for panel access
$user = User::find(1);
$user->is_approved = true;
$user->save();
```

## Testing
1. Set `APP_ENV=production` in your `.env` file
2. Try accessing the Filament admin panel
3. Only users meeting the criteria in `canAccessPanel()` should have access

## Security Notes
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Keep your `APP_KEY` secure
- Regularly review user access permissions
- Monitor panel access logs
